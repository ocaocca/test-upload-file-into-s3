# test-upload-file-into-s3
This is a repository from my dummy folder as a part of developing our final project, "LEKTUR" (https://gitlab.com/glints-academy-batch-10/lektur)
This repo contains a short code to upload files in to AWS S3 Bucket and using FFMPEG to get thumbnail from the video!
Thank you!
